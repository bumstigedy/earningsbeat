    <h1>Predicting earnings beats</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>by Sanjay Shah</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>The goal</h2>
    <p>When I first began holding individual stocks, I learned that prices can be quite volatile around earnings. This
        may be due to a beat, miss,
        or guidance given during the earnings call. I thought it would be interesting to try and predict if a stock will
        beat or miss the earnings estimate. The goal of this personal project is to predict the probability that a stock
        will beat
        its earnings estimate.
        We won't make any prediction about how the price will react; that can be the goal of another project.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Percent change in stock price over the last 10 days. The theory is that smart investors, who know that an
            earnings beat is likely, may
            bid up the price ahead of the earnings release.
        </li>
        <li>Trend status. The basis for this feature is similar to the one above, but takes a longer term view. The RSI
            was used to determine the status of the trend.
            <ol>
                <li>Oversold in a bullish trend. Current RSI 50 or below and RSI hasn't recently gone below 40</li>
                <li>Overbought in a bullish trend. Current RSI 80 or above and RSI hasn't recently gone below 40</li>
                <li>Oversold in a bearish trend. Current RSI 20 or below and RSI has recently gone below 40</li>
                <li>Overbought in a bearish trend. Current RSI 50 or above and RSI has recently gone below 40</li>
                <li>Neutral when none of the above apply</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Earnings suprise history. The theory is that if they have recently been beating earnings, they are likely to
            continue. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2> The model</h2>
    <p> A tensorflow deep neural network was used to create a binary classification model. </p>
    <h2>The data</h2>
    <p>Free data on the stocks currently in the S&P500. </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The model's accuracy was around 70%. This sounds ok, but given that the stocks beat earnings most of the time it
        is not much better than
        just always predicting a beat. The results varied by stock, and the model worked beter for some stocks. Let's
        look at a few examples.
    <div>
        <h4>United Airlines</h4>
        <div>
            <p> If we use a threshold of 60% to 70% for an earnings beat, the model does an ok job. The chart shows
                price in the top panel, RSI in
                the middle panel, and the beat probability and actual beat or miss on the bottom. You can click on the
                link below for an interactive
                full screen chart which is easier to read.

    <br>
    <div>
        <h4>JP Morgan</h4>
        <div>
            <p> We see similar results here. A threshold of 60% to 70% seems ok, but does not work all the time!

    <h2> So what</h2>
    <p> This was a fun project which allowed me to practice machine learning with tensorflow.
        The model is not good enough to use for any investment decisions. It could potentially be improved by trying out
        different features.
        One idea is to use impled volatility from the options market, but that data costs money so I won't be trying
        that
        any time soon.
        Below are links to all the test results in case you would like to look through them. Please note that I used
        unadjusted prices
        since they were free. This resutls in some funny looking price charts around splits. This should not have much
        of an impact on the
        model since it only uses about 90 days of price history at time.
